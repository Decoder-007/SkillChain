# SkillChain

SkillChain is a decentralized platform designed to manage skill certifications on the blockchain. This platform ensures that certificates are verifiable, secure, and immutable, leveraging blockchain technology for transparent skill validation.

## Features

1. **Blockchain-based Skill Validation**: Certificates issued through the platform are tamper-proof and easily verifiable.
2. **Smart Contracts**: Skill certificates are managed using Move-based smart contracts.
3. **Frontend Interface**: Users can easily interact with the platform to manage their certifications.

## Technologies

1. **Move**: For creating and managing smart contracts.
2. **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
3. **Backend**: Server-side logic for blockchain interactions.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: Contains the server-side code.
- `contracts/`: Smart contract files for managing skill certifications.
- `frontend/`: User interface code.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git clone https://github.com/Decoder-007/SkillChain.git 
2. Deploy the smart contracts using a blockchain testnet.
3. Open `frontend/index.html` to interact with the platform.
